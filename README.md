# vaacus-packages
void-packages uncaged

# How to use ?

```
cat custom_shlibs >> common/shlibs
```
Use as you would for [void-packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages).


# Why ?
The good Void people's official (*and unofficial*) requirements for being included into the official repos are comically intransigent.
